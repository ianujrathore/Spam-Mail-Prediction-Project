# Spam-Mail-Prediction-Project

This project focuses on building a smart system that can automatically identify whether an email is spam or genuine. By analyzing the text and patterns commonly found in spam emails, the model learns to recognize suspicious messages and filter them out before they reach the user’s inbox. The goal is to save time, reduce annoyance, and protect users from potential scams by making email communication cleaner and safer in a simple, efficient way.
